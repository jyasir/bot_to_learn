# Programming an onboard LED light on the Raspberry Pi Pico to Display SOS Distress Signal
## What is a SOS Distress Signal and when its used

# Setting up the board

'''What are the steps involved in setting up the board

 1. We need to import the Pins in our Program
 2. Need to import the clock cycle in the form of time
 3. Specify the pin of the LED that is connected to Raspberry Pi Pico

# Now need to study the Maths of the SOS Signal

'''

  The SOS distress signal includes two characters i.e. S and O
  We need to program the LED to show different blinking patterns for S and O
  
  Now think about we would like to keep the LED on for 1 sec for S and 2 sec for O so anyone can easily distinguish
  the signal with blinking pattern
  
  For our program we would do this in a way,
  
  S = . . .
  
  O = __ __ __
  
  S = . . .
  
  and the complete message would be
  
  SOS = . . . __ __ __ . . .
